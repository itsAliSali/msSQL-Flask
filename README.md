# msSQL-Flask
In this project, my groupmates and I, created a relational database schema for acomplex Application. At the end, we created a web UI to show some of the capabilities of the app.

The App has three types of users: Educational Institutions, Developers, and Companies. Developers could enroll in classes offered by educational institutions and they might apply for job oppurtunities offered by companies. Companies can hold competitions and developers can compete in them. Lots of functionalities like: registering at classes, submitting tasks, applying for jobs, creating competitions, posting job offers are implemented.

Here is the data diagram of the App:

Note: 
* This code is prone to sql injection and many other security leaks. Password are kept as plane text. And many other bad practices! This project was done for educational purposes only.
